# My PyCaret 7-Quest Assignment

This project contains all 7 of my PyCaret tasks, run locally in VS Code.

## Notes on Requirements

* **`use_gpu=True` Requirement:** The `setup()` function in all scripts is set to `use_gpu=False`. A local check confirmed my machine does not have an NVIDIA CUDA-compatible GPU, so `False` was required for the code to run.
* **Task 6 (Association Rules):** This task was skipped due to a persistent local environment conflict with Python 3.13 and the `arules` module. All other 6 tasks are complete and functional.

## Tasks Completed
* [x] Task 1: Binary Classification
* [x] Task 2: Multiclass Classification
* [x] Task 3: Regression
* [x] Task 4: Clustering
* [x] Task 5: Anomaly Detection
* [ ] Task 6: Association Rules (Skipped)
* [x] Task 7: Time Series Forecasting
